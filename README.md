# Welcome To My Front-End Skullify-Client Application!

## Ultimate goal for the application

Using React, build the client-side for an application called Skullify based on its existing
server-side code (REST API and database) which is located here https://github.com/webcodejunkie/movie_api

You can also find a link to where I'm hosting Skullify — Through Netlify https://skullify.netlify.app/

## The 5 W's for this application

1. Who—The users of the Skullify application. They will be movie enthusiasts who enjoy
reading information about different movies.

2. What—A single-page, responsive application with routing, rich interactions, several
interface views, and a polished user experience. The client-side developed in this
project will support the existing server-side from movie_api (the server-side for this application) by facilitating user
requests and rendering the response from the server-side via a number of different
interface views.

3. When—Skullify users will be able to use it whenever they want to read information about
different movies or update their user information—for instance, their list of “Favorite
Movies.”

4. Where—The application will be hosted online. The Skullify application itself is responsive
and can therefore be used anywhere and on any device, giving all users the same
experience.

5. Why—Movie enthusiasts like to be able to access information about different movies,
directors, and genres, whenever they want to. Having the ability to save lists of favorite
movies will ensure users always have access to the films they want to watch or
recommend to their peers.
